# utm-studio

A tiny web app that generates UTM-tagged URLs for consistent campaign attribution.

## Problem
Teams create broken or inconsistent UTM links, which makes attribution unreliable and reporting messy.

## What this prototype does
- Generates valid UTM URLs (source, medium, campaign, optional content)
- Updates output instantly as inputs change
- Supports base URLs that already contain query parameters
- Copy-to-clipboard in one click

## Live demo
(Add your Vercel link here after deploy)

## What I’d build next
- Presets (Google Ads / Meta / Email)
- Naming convention rules + validation
- Save recent UTMs (localStorage)
- Shareable links (template encoded in URL)
- AI assist: generate a UTM template from examples + suggest fixes
